# InfinityTeleport

Desktop only for now!

This is a VRChat Melonloader Mod to Teleport into a Place where unity just cant load anything and is completely scuffed. This help when people are being funny and attach themselves to your Avatar. You can just yeet them of to the Infinity and if they dont have a Hotkey to Respawn, they have to Restart their game, because they cant open their menu.

Just press Ctrl + I to Teleport to Infinity and Ctrl + F8 to teleport to spawn, so you dont get stuck there.
